* Introduction

** Motivation

   *Goal* -- Cleanse noisy RFID readings for indoor location service.

   - People spend lots of time indoor.
   - GPS is unavailable.
   - RFID receiver is cheaper
   - RFID raw readings are noisy, e.g., false negative readings.
   - Existing solutions do not fit our problem, e.g., static objects
     cite:baba2014-handling, grid-layout setting cite:geng2014-indoor,
     event stream queries cite:re2008-event,welbourne2008-cascadia,
     etc.

** Spatial Queries

   Conventional definition

   - Range query :: Decide the objects that lie in a given range.
   - \(k\)-nearest neighbor query :: Decide the \(k\) nearest objects
        w.r.t a given query point.


   Probabilistic interpretation

   - Range query :: Decide the objects that lie in a given range with
        probability larger than a threshold.
   - \(k\)-nearest neighbor query :: Decide the \(k^\prime\) nearest
        objects whose probability sum is no less than \(k\).

** Simplification -- Walking Graph

   1. Hallways \(\to\) graph edges.
   2. Crosses \(\to\) graph nodes.
   3. Rooms \(\to\) graph nodes.


   Rooms differ from crosses: /maximum stay duration/.

** Simplification -- Anchor Point

   - Objects are rounded to the nearest /anchor point/.
   - Anchor points are indexed by R-tree.

* System

** Overview

   [[file:img/system-design.pdf]]

   - Data Collector :: generates ground truth data.
   - Query Optimization :: filters out /non-candidates/.
   - Bayesian Filters :: cleanse the noisy RFID data.
   - Query Evaluation :: answers spatial queries.

** Event-Driven Data Collector

   [[file:img/data-collector.pdf]]

   The data collected is
   \[o_1: (t_1, r_1), (t_2, \text{NIL}), (t_3, r_2), (t_4, \text{NIL}),
   \dots\]

** Optimization Model

   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .7\textwidth
   [[file:img/uncertainty.pdf]]

   We are pruning /non-candidates/ by their uncertainty range.
   - \tikz\fill[blue!20] circle [radius=.5em]; denotes the reader
     range.
   - \tikz\fill[green!20] circle [radius=.5em]; denotes the
     uncertainty range.

** Optimization Model -- Range Query

   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .5\textwidth
   [[file:img/range-filter.pdf]]

   The candidate set is \(\{o_1, o_2, o_3\}\)

** Optimization Model -- \(k\)NN Query

   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width .5\textwidth
   [[file:img/knn-filter.pdf]]

   The candidate set for 2NN query \(\{o_1, o_2, o_3\}\).

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   We want to track the object.

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   Generate random guesses, i.e., particles.

   [[file:img/pf1.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   Particles that explain the observation well get larger weights.

   [[file:img/pf2.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   Resample /good/ particles to keep population size.

   [[file:img/pf3.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   In case of a false negative, predict with particles.

   [[file:img/pf4.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Particle Filter

   Align particles to the nearest anchor point.

   [[file:img/pf5.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   We want to track the object.

   [[file:img/kf0.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   Each reading is an observation.

   [[file:img/kf1.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   We have a new observation and guess from the past.

   [[file:img/kf2.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   We combine these two to form an adjusted guess.

   [[file:img/kf3.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   In case of a false negative, predict from pass guess.

   [[file:img/kf4.pdf]]

** Bayesian Filtering -- Kalman Filter

   Assign /normalized/ probability to anchors points.

** Range Query Window Size

   1. KL value lower is better.
   2. Query window size is the ratio of areas between query window and
      total environment.

** \(k\) in \(k\)NN

   1. Hit rate higher is better.
   2. \(k\) is the number of nearest neighbors.

** Number of Particles

   1. KL value lower is better.
   2. This parameter only applies to particle filter.

   [[file:img/kl-p.pdf]]

** Number of Moving Objects

   1. KL value lower is better.
   2. Total number of objects in the environment.

** Detection Range

   1. KL value lower is better.
   2. The detection range of each reader.

** Change of Volume

   Suppose \(t_1\) the result set is \(\{o_1, o_2, o_3\}\), and
   \(t_2\) the result changes to \(\{o_1, o_2, o_4\}\), then the
   change volume is 2.

* Discussion

** Summary

   1. We designed Bayesian-filter algorithms for RFID data cleansing.
   2. We propose indoor walking graph model and anchor point model to
      simplify the filter process.
   3. We propose two metrics to evaluate continuous queries.
   4. Extensive experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our
      solutions compared with symbolic model.

** Future Work

   1. Test on real-world data.
   2. Experiment with more diverse environment settings.
